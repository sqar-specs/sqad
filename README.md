# Rationale

- single file storage for complex database objects
- like-for-like format: databases perserved in a database format
- preserved databases remain accessible as databases using standard tooling
- rich metadata baked-in 
- easy handling, easy access
- based on ubiquitous, public domain, stable, tested foundation (SQLite)
